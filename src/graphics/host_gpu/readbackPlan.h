// How the bytes the host GPU wrote into a guest buffer get back into guest memory when the guest
// touches their page.
//
// The general way is a copy command into a download buffer and a wait for everything recorded so
// far. That wait stops the GPU thread for as long as the host GPU needs for the whole frame up to
// that point, and a game can ask for it many times per frame.
//
// Where the CPU can read the buffer's memory, no copy is needed: the bytes are final once the
// last GPU-side write of the buffer has finished. So the read-back waits for that one submission
// only, and whoever asked does the waiting. A guest thread that faulted waits itself, and the GPU
// thread goes on recording. The GPU thread only does what must be done there: submit, when the
// write still sits in the open command buffer, and publish, when the write has finished.
