// What a draw does when its graphics pipeline is not built yet.
//
// A pipeline is built on a worker thread. With the driver's caches warm that takes about a
// millisecond; on a machine that sees the game for the first time the host has to compile the
// shaders, which takes 100 ms to 2 s per pipeline, and a level asks for several new pipelines
// per second. A draw that waited would stop the picture for each of them.
//
// So a draw that only changes the picture is left out until its pipeline is built: the object or
// effect appears a few frames late, once per pipeline on this machine. A draw that changes more
// than the picture waits: what its shaders write to memory, and the depth clear it carries, are
// read by later work, and leaving them out would change what the game computes.
//
// A picture the game draws once and reads for the rest of the level (a colour table, a light
// probe, an atlas) is the same: left out once, it stays missing. The game's own frames tell the
// two apart: a target drawn in the previous frame as well is drawn again anyway, so a draw into
// it may be left out; a draw into any other target waits.
//
// Leaving a draw out keeps what the target held before it: last frame's picture, when the game
// draws over it. A target the game clears or overwrites (a copy, an upload, a compute write) in
// this frame holds the clear colour instead, and every object left out of it shows as a black
// hole until its pipeline is built. So in a frame in which a target was reset, a draw into it
// waits (TargetHistory), but only within a budget per frame: games clear most targets every
// frame, and at a level start on a machine that sees the game for the first time about 200 new
// pipelines of 30 to 450 ms each are needed one after another. Waiting for all of them stopped
// the game for 10 to 40 s (measured). Past the budget such a draw is left out, and the black hole
// shows until its pipeline is built.
//
// What this cannot see: a draw into one region of a target the game otherwise redraws (that
// region stays missing), and a target the game later copies into memory it reads (the bytes
// miss the draw). Both need knowledge of what the game does next, which the draw does not have.
