//
// A game reads back results the GPU computes: Unreal Engine renders the average brightness of a
// sky light into a 1x1 render target and reads that pixel with the CPU. In Crash Bandicoot 4 that
// target is tiled. Guest memory kept its old bytes, the CPU read a brightness of 0, the reflections
// were divided by it, and leaves and walls came out white.
//
// So every image of at most READBACK_TINY_EXTENT pixels on each side is copied back, tiled or
// linear: such images are read back far more often than sampled again, and each copy is a few
// bytes. Block-compressed images are left out; the GPU does not render them. Larger linear images
// are copied back only when the setting asks for it (--readback-linear-images).
