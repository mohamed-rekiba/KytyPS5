// Tracks one fence per submission of a queue and tells when a submission has retired: when its
// fence, and so the fence of every earlier submission, is signalled.
//
// `Ops` supplies the fence calls: Create(), IsSignaled(fence), Reset(span of fences), Wait(fence)
// and Destroy(fence). Wait may return before the fence is signalled; the state is checked again. Resetting needs exclusive access to a fence, so a fence is reset only while
// no thread waits on one. Acquire is called by the submitting thread; IsRetired and WaitRetired
// by any thread.
