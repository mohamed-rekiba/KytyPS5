// Where the CPU wrote guest memory since the last upload pass (RenderContext::PrepareBda): a
// shader that reads through device addresses can read any cached buffer, so before it runs every
// buffer must hold the CPU's latest bytes, and the pass synchronizes only the logged ranges.
//
// Two kinds of ranges come in:
// - A write: a fault on a watched page, a write by the GPU thread itself (WRITE_DATA, a label),
//   a buffer created over written memory. The next pass must see it.
// - A hot range: uploaded and left open (writeHeat.h), so the CPU's next writes to it neither
//   fault nor reach the log. It is due again once the next guest submission starts. The CPU's
//   writes to it while the GPU processes a submission race with that submission on the console
//   too; the GPU thread's own writes come in as writes.
//
// Safe to call from several threads.
