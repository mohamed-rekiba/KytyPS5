// What a garbage-collection pass of the buffer and texture caches frees.
//
// The caches collect when the device memory in use reaches a trigger derived from the memory
// budget. A GPU with memory of its own reaches it. On a GPU that uses the system memory the budget
// is most of that memory (32 GB on an M4 Max with 36 GB), and a game never reaches the trigger: the
// caches keep every buffer and image they ever made.
//
// That costs more than memory: MoltenVK attaches every live resource to every command buffer. In
// Crash Bandicoot 4 the GPU time of a frame grew from about 20 ms to 75 ms in five minutes, and the
// game fell from 27 to 7 fps. With idle passes in the texture cache it stayed at 15 to 16 fps.
//
// So on system memory a texture-cache pass also frees, below the trigger, images that were unused
// for the idle age. An idle pass keeps GPU-written images: images the GPU wrote and the CPU has not
// read back. It marks them as used now, so that they do not stop the pass from reaching the images
// behind them.
//
// The buffer cache has no idle passes. Shaders reach buffers through device addresses, and that
// access neither marks a buffer as used nor records what it writes. A buffer that looks idle can
// hold GPU results the guest has not read yet, and freeing it clears its entries in the
// device-address page table. Idle passes of the buffer cache froze Crash Bandicoot 4 after about
// three minutes, in two of five runs.
