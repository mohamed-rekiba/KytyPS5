// Which pages of a tracked region the guest writes again and again.
//
// A clean page is write-protected, so that the first write to it is seen. A game that rewrites a
// buffer many times per frame then pays, for each page and each time: a fault, a protection
// change in the fault handler, and another one when the renderer has uploaded the page. A page
// that keeps coming back like this is "hot": it stays open and counts as written, and the
// renderer uploads it at every use: at every bind, and once per guest submission for shaders
// that read through device addresses (cpuWriteLog.h). That is always correct, since an upload of
// unchanged bytes changes nothing; it trades the faults for copies.
//
// The heat is a lease of LeaseFrames guest frames (RegionManager::NoteFrame). At the first upload
// after the lease, the page is clean again: it is protected before its bytes are copied, so a
// later write faults and is seen. A page the game still writes faults once and is hot again at
// once; one it stopped writing stays protected. A game that writes a buffer once per frame then
// pays one fault per lease instead of one or two per frame, and a ring buffer touched once per lap
// is not uploaded for long after its last write.
//
// Heat is also forgotten from time to time (CoolAll), for pages that no pass uploads.
