// Every buffer of the cache can be reached through device addresses, and MoltenVK attaches each
// such buffer to every command encoder: the cost of a frame grows with the number of buffers. A
// buffer that covers only the bytes of its first use makes many small buffers. In Crash Bandicoot
// 4 the cache held about 6,500 buffers of about 100 KB after five minutes, and the game fell from
// 43 to 7 fps.
//
// So a new buffer covers the whole chunk of guest memory around its first use, cut at the ends of
// the mapping that holds it. A buffer is never freed because it is idle (see cacheCollection.h),
// so fewer, larger buffers are what bound the count.
