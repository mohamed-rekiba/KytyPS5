// of GPU work when every guest command buffer was submitted on its own). Guest command buffers are
// therefore merged into one host submission until one of these holds:
//   - a completion callback waits for the open submission (an end-of-pipe interrupt, a flip);
//   - the GPU thread is about to wait for the guest, so nothing more would join;
//   - the open submission holds enough draws and dispatches, or its first command is old enough,
//     so that the GPU is not left idle while the CPU records.
// Points that need the submission for correctness (a read-back of bytes the open submission writes,
// a wait for its tick, Finish) submit directly and do not come here.
